# designate-operator
A Kubernetes Operator built using the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework)
for Go. The Operator provides a way to easily install and manage an OpenStack
Designate installation on Kubernetes. This Operator was developed using
[RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org/) containers for openStack.

## Description
Designate is an Open Source DNS-as-a-Service implementation and a part of the
OpenStack ecosystem of services for running clouds. Designate is an OpenStack
service that allows users and operators to manage DNS records, names and
zones via a REST API and can configure existing DNS name servers to contain
those records. Designate can also be configured by an operator to integrate
with both the OpenStack Network Service (Neutron) and the Compute Service
(Nova) so that records are automatically created when floating IPs and compute
instances are created respectively, and uses the OpenStack Identity Service
(Keystone) for user management. Since there are a multitude of software
implementations of the DNS name server, Designate has a pluggable backend that
can be configured to manage many of them, most notably BIND9 and PowerDNS.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/designate-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/designate-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
